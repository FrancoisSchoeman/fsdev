# My Personal Website

Welcome to my digital corner of the internet! This is where I showcase my work, share my thoughts, and occasionally pretend that I'm not drinking coffee right now.

## What's This All About?

This is my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, featuring:

- My professional experience and projects
- Tech stack and skills (including my sim racing prowess)
- Contact information for when you might need a developer who can also talk about Formula 1
- A healthy dose of personality (because boring portfolios are... boring)

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - Because React is awesome, but Next.js is React's cooler sibling
- **TypeScript** - For when JavaScript needs to grow up
- **Tailwind CSS** - Making things pretty while saving time
- **Shadcn/ui** - Components that actually look good out of the box
- **Lucide Icons** - Icons that don't make your eyes bleed

## Getting Started

Want to run this locally? (Maybe you're curious about my code, or maybe you just like running random projects)

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone [your-repo-url]

# Install the magic dependencies
npm install

# Fire up the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and voil√†! You're now looking at my website on your machine.

## Features

- **Responsive Design** - Looks good on everything from phones to ultrawide monitors
- **Fast Loading** - Optimized images and performance (I don't like waiting, neither should you)
- **SEO Optimized** - Google will find me (hopefully)
- **Coffee-Powered** - Built with 73% caffeine and 27% determination

## Fun Facts About This Project

- Written entirely while listening to heavy metal (sorry, neighbors)
- Debugged with an unhealthy amount of coffee
- Contains exactly zero jQuery (we've evolved, people!)
