If you’ve ever needed to juggle **two GitHub accounts** - say, a personal one and a work one - on the same machine, you’ll know it’s not always plug-and-play.
The good news: once you set it up correctly, you can switch between them seamlessly.

This guide is my **battle-tested recipe** for running two accounts side-by-side via SSH on Windows (using Git Bash or any OpenSSH-capable shell). I’ll also show you how to commit with the right identity **and** handle brand-new projects.

---

## 1. Create a Separate SSH Key for Your Second Account

We’ll keep your personal SSH key as-is and create a new one for your work account.

1. **Open Git Bash** (or PowerShell if OpenSSH is installed).
2. Run:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 \
     -C "your.work.email@domain.com" \
     -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work
   ```

   - Press **Enter** through the prompts (set a passphrase if you want extra security).
   - This will give you:

     - `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work` (private key)
     - `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work.pub` (public key)

---

## 2. Add the New Key to Your Work GitHub Account

1. Copy your **public key** to the clipboard:

   ```bash
   clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work.pub
   ```

2. Log into your **work GitHub account** in the browser.

3. Go to **Settings → SSH and GPG Keys → New SSH key**.

4. Paste the key and save.

---

## 3. Configure SSH to Tell the Keys Apart

Edit (or create) your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```text
# PERSONAL ACCOUNT (default)
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# WORK ACCOUNT
Host github-work
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work
```

---

## 4. Load Both Keys

Run:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work
```

_(Optional) Add these lines to `~/.bash_profile` so they run automatically each session._

---

## 5. Cloning Repos for the Right Account

- **Personal repo** (no changes needed):

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:personalUser/repo-name.git
  ```

- **Work repo** (use the `github-work` alias):

  ```bash
  git clone git@github-work:workUser/repo-name.git
  ```

**If you already cloned a work repo** and need to switch it to the work account:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github-work:workUser/repo-name.git
```

---

## 6. Set the Right Git Identity

Git commits are stamped with the `user.name` and `user.email` from your config.

### Option 1 - Per Repo

Inside a work repo:

```bash
git config user.name  "Your Work Name"
git config user.email "your.work.email@domain.com"
```

### Option 2 - Auto-Select by Folder

If you store all work repos under `~/projects/work/`, edit `~/.gitconfig`:

```ini
[user]
  name  = Your Personal Name
  email = your.personal@email.com

[includeIf "gitdir:~/projects/work/"]
  path = ~/.gitconfig-work
```

Then create `~/.gitconfig-work`:

```ini
[user]
  name  = Your Work Name
  email = your.work.email@domain.com
```

---

## 7. Starting a New Project With the Right Account

When creating a **new work project**:

1. **Make the folder** in your work directory (if using the conditional config):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/projects/work/my-new-project
   cd ~/projects/work/my-new-project
   ```

2. **Initialize Git**:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Check your identity** (should show your work details if in the work folder):

   ```bash
   git config user.name
   git config user.email
   ```

4. **Create the remote repo** on your work GitHub account (via browser).

5. **Add the remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github-work:workUser/my-new-project.git
   ```

6. **Commit and push**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

For a **new personal project**, just follow the same steps but use your normal GitHub host and personal account.

---

## 8. Quick Verification

You can check that both keys and accounts are working:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
# Hi personalUser!

ssh -T git@github-work
# Hi workUser!
```

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Remote Name Conflicts

If you see:

```
error: remote origin already exists.
```

It means the remote is already set.
You can either:

- **Update the existing remote**:

  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin git@github-work:workUser/repo-name.git
  ```

- **Add a second remote**:

  ```bash
  git remote add work git@github-work:workUser/repo-name.git
  git push work main
  ```

---

## Final Thoughts

Once this is set up, switching between personal and work repos is seamless.
The SSH alias ensures the right account is used for pushes, and the per-repo or conditional Git configs ensure commits have the right name and email.

You can now **clone, commit, and push** to both accounts from the same laptop - no more re-authentication gymnastics.
